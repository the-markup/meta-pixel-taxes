# Meta Pixel - Tax Preparation Sites

This repository contains screenshots and HAR files supporting our article "[Tax Filing Websites Have Been Sending Usersâ€™ Financial Information to Facebook](https://themarkup.org/pixel-hunt/2022/11/22/tax-filing-websites-have-been-sending-users-financial-information-to-facebook)" from the series [Pixel Hunt](https://themarkup.org/series/pixel-hunt).

In the repository there is a folder for each tax preparer mentioned in the article. Inside the folder are screenshots of relevant data being sent to Facebook via the Meta Pixel, and [HAR files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HAR_(file_format)) saved during the process of documenting the data collection.

Additional data for the story came from users who opted to contribute their data to the [Mozilla Rally](https://rally.mozilla.org/) project, however due to the sensitive nature of this data The Markup is not making it available.

Additional information on our partnership with Mozilla Rally, how the Meta Pixel works, and our data collection process can be found in our methodology article "[How We Built a Meta Pixel Inspector](https://themarkup.org/show-your-work/2022/04/28/how-we-built-a-meta-pixel-inspector)."
